Interactive Session . 2020-11-18, 11:10 - 11:40 PST | PheedLoop Session . Abstract . During retinal microsurgery, precise manipulation of the delicate retinal tissue is required for positive surgical outcome. However, accurate manipulation and navigation of surgical tools remain difficult due to a constrained workspace and the top-down view during the surgery, which limits the surgeonâ€™s ability to estimate depth. To alleviate such difficulty, we propose to automate the tool-navigation task by learning to predict relative goal position on the retinal surface from the current tool-tip position. Given an estimated target on the retina, we generate an optimal trajectory leading to the predicted goal while imposing safety-related physical constraints aimed to minimize tissue damage. As an extended task, we generate goal predictions to various points across the retina to localize eye geometry and further generate safe trajectories within the estimated confines. Through experiments in both simulation and with several eye phantoms, we demonstrate that our framework can permit navigation to various points on the retina within 0.089mm and 0.118mm in xy error which is less than the humanâ€™s surgeon mean tremor at the tool-tip of 0.180mm. All safety constraints were fulfilled and the algorithm was robust to previously unseen eyes as well as unseen objects in the scene.

Interactive Session . 2020-11-16, 12:30 - 13:00 PST | PheedLoop Session . Abstract . The crucial step for localization is to match the current observation to the map. When the two sensor modalities are significantly different, matching becomes challenging. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep phase correlation network (DPCN) to match heterogeneous sensor measurements. In DPCN, the primary component is a differentiable correlation-based estimator that back-propagates the pose error to learnable feature extractors, which addresses the problem that there are no direct common features for supervision. In addition, it eliminates the exhaustive evaluation in some previous methods, improving efficiency. With the interpretable modeling, the network is light-weighted and promising for better generalization. We evaluate the system on both the simulation data and Aero-Ground Dataset which consists of heterogeneous sensor images and aerial images acquired by satellites or aerial robots. The results show that our method is able to match the heterogeneous sensor measurements, outperforming the comparative traditional phase correlation and other learning-based methods.
