    "content": "Paper PDF . Authors . Soeren Pirk (Google)*; Karol Hausman (Google Brain); Alexander Toshev (Google); Mohi Khansari (X, The Moonshot Factory) . Abstract . Task planning over long-time horizons is a challenging and open problem in robotics and its complexity grows exponentially with an increasing number of subtasks. In this paper we present a deep neural network that learns dependencies and transitions across subtasks solely from a set of demonstration videos. We represent each subtasks as action symbols (e.g. move cup), and show that these symbols can be learned and predicted directly from image observations. Learning symbol sequences provides the network with additional information about the most frequent transitions and relevant dependencies between subtasks and thereby structures tasks over long-time horizons. Learning from images, on the other hand, allows the network to continuously monitor the task progress and thus to interactively adapt to changes in the environment. We evaluate our framework on two long horizon tasks: (1) block stacking of puzzle pieces being executed by humans, and (2) a robot manipulation task involving pick and place of objects and sliding a cabinet door with a 7-DoF robot arm. We show that complex plans can be carried out when executing the robotic task and the robot can interactively adapt to changes in the environment and recover from failure cases. Video . Reviews .

    "content": "Paper PDF Code . Authors . Prasoon Goyal (The University of Texas at Austin)*; Scott Niekum (UT Austin); Raymond Mooney (Univ. of Texas at Austin) . Abstract . Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in sparse reward settings, often requires prohibitively large numbers of interactions with the environment, thereby limiting its applicability to complex problems. To address this, several prior approaches have used natural language to guide the agent’s exploration. However, these approaches typically operate on structured representations of the environment, and/or assume some structure in the natural language commands. In this work, we propose a model that directly maps pixels to rewards, given a free-form natural language description of the task, which can then be used for policy learning. Our experiments on the Meta-World robot manipulation domain show that language-based rewards significantly improves the sample efficiency of policy learning, both in sparse and dense reward settings.

Joel Ye (Georgia Institute of Technology)*; Dhruv Batra (Georgia Tech &amp; Facebook AI Research); Erik Wijmans (Georgia Tech); Abhishek Das (Facebook AI Research) . Abstract . PointGoal Navigation is an embodied task that requires agents to navigate to a specified point in an unseen environment. Wijmans et al. showed that this task is solvable in simulation but their method is computationally prohibitive – requiring 2.5 billion frames of experience and 180 GPU-days. We develop a method to significantly improve sample efficiency in learning PointNav using self-supervised auxiliary tasks (e.g. predicting the action taken between two egocentric observations, predicting the distance between two observations from a trajectory, etc.). We find that naively combining multiple auxiliary tasks improves sample efficiency, but only provides marginal gains beyond a point. To overcome this, we use attention to combine representations from individual auxiliary tasks. Our best agent is 5.5x faster to match the performance of the previous state-of-the-art, DD-PPO, at 40M frames, and improves on DD-PPO’s performance at 40M frames by 0.16 SPL.

Direct search for objects as part of navigation poses a challenge for small items. Utilizing context in the form of object-object relationships enable hierarchical search for targets efficiently. Most of the current approaches tend to directly incorporate sensory input into a reward-based learning approach, without learning about object relationships in the natural environment, and thus generalize poorly across domains. We present Memory-utilized Joint hierarchical Object Learning for Navigation in Indoor Rooms (MJOLNIR), a target-driven navigation algorithm, which considers the inherent relationship between target objects, and the more salient contextual objects occurring in its surrounding. Extensive experiments conducted across multiple environment settings show an 82.9% and 93.5% gain over existing state-of-the-art navigation methods in terms of the success rate (SR), and success weighted by path length (SPL), respectively. We also show that our model learns to converge much faster than other algorithms, without suffering from the well-known overfitting problem.

Abstract . Imitation learning is well-suited for robotic tasks where it is difficult to directly program the behavior or specify a cost for optimal control. In this work, we propose a method for learning the reward function (and the corresponding policy) to match the expert state density. Our main result is the analytic gradient of any f-divergence between the agent and expert state distribution w.r.t. reward parameters. Based on the derived gradient, we present an algorithm, f-IRL, that recovers a stationary reward function from the expert density by gradient descent. We show that f-IRL can learn behaviors from a hand-designed target state density or implicitly through expert observations. Our method outperforms adversarial imitation learning methods in terms of sample efficiency and the required number of expert trajectories on IRL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that the recovered reward function can be used to quickly solve downstream tasks, and empirically demonstrate its utility on hard-to-explore tasks and for behavior transfer across changes in dynamics.

Accurately modeling robot dynamics is crucial to safe and efficient motion control. In this paper, we develop and apply an iterative learning semi-parametric model, with a neural network, to the task of autonomous racing with a Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We present a novel non-linear semi-parametric dynamics model where we represent the known dynamics with a parametric model, and a neural network captures the unknown dynamics. We show that our model can learn more accurately than a purely parametric model and generalize better than a purely non-parametric model, making it ideal for real-world applications where collecting data from the full state space is not feasible. We present a system where the model is bootstrapped on pre-recorded data and then updated iteratively at run time. Then we apply our iterative learning approach to the simulated problem of autonomous racing and show that it can safely adapt to modified dynamics online and even achieve better performance than models trained on data from manual driving.

Then, using the learned models, we use simple model-based planning to solve challenging deformable object manipulation tasks such as spreading ropes and cloths.

Abstract . Seamlessly interacting with humans or robots is hard because these agents are non-stationary. They update their policy in response to the ego agent’s behavior, and the ego agent must anticipate these changes to co-adapt. Inspired by humans, we recognize that robots do not need to explicitly model every low-level action another agent will make; instead, we can capture the latent strategy of other agents through high-level representations. We propose a reinforcement learning-based framework for learning latent representations of an agent’s policy, where the ego agent identifies the relationship between its behavior and the other agent’s future strategy. The ego agent then leverages these latent dynamics to influence the other agent, purposely guiding them towards policies suitable for co-adaptation. Across several simulated domains and a real-world air hockey game, our approach outperforms the alternatives and learns to influence the other agent. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . Deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents are able to learn contact-rich manipulation tasks by maximizing a reward signal, but require large amounts of experience, especially in environments with many obstacles that complicate exploration. In contrast, motion planners use explicit models of the agent and environment to plan collision-free paths to faraway goals, but suffer from inaccurate models in tasks that require contacts with the environment. To combine the benefits of both approaches, we propose motion planner augmented RL (MoPA-RL) which augments the action space of an RL agent with the long-horizon planning capabilities of motion planners. Based on the magnitude of the action, our approach smoothly transitions between directly executing the action and invoking a motion planner. We evaluate our approach on various simulated manipulation tasks and compare it to alternative action spaces in terms of learning efficiency and safety. The experiments demonstrate that MoPA-RL increases learning efficiency, leads to a faster exploration, and results in safer policies that avoid collisions with the environment.

Yuchen Cui (University of Texas at Austin)*; Qiping Zhang (The University of Texas at Austin); Brad Knox (Bosch); Alessandro Allievi (Bosch); Peter Stone (University of Texas at Austin and Sony AI); Scott Niekum (UT Austin) . Abstract . Reactions such as gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations are an abundant, naturally occurring channel of information that humans provide during interactions. A robot or other agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this paper, we first define the general problem of learning from implicit human feedback and then propose to address this problem through a novel data-driven framework, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method consists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task. We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while subjects observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories.

Furthermore, localized soft range gating combined with a 3D box-refinement stage improves robustness in occluded areas, and produces overall more accurate bounding box predictions.

Robots that can learn in the physical world will be important to enable robots to escape their stiff and pre-programmed movements. For dynamic high-acceleration tasks, such as juggling, learning in the real-world is particularly challenging as one must push the limits of the robot and its actuation without harming the system, amplifying the necessity of sample efficiency and safety for robot learning algorithms.

Modern nonlinear control theory seeks to develop feedback controllers that endow systems with properties such as safety and stability. The guarantees ensured by these controllers often rely on accurate estimates of the system state for determining control actions. In practice, measurement model uncertainty can lead to error in state estimates that degrades these guarantees. In this paper, we seek to unify techniques from control theory and machine learning to synthesize controllers that achieve safety in the presence of measurement model uncertainty. We define the notion of a Measurement-Robust Control Barrier Function (MR-CBF) as a tool for determining safe control inputs when facing measurement model uncertainty. Furthermore, MR-CBFs are used to inform sampling methodologies for learning-based perception systems and quantify tolerable error in the resulting learned models.

Abstract . We study the challenging problem of releasing a robot in a previously unseen environment, and having it follow unconstrained natural language navigation instructions. Recent work on the task of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has achieved significant progress in simulation. To assess the implications of this work for robotics, we transfer a VLN agent trained in simulation to a physical robot. To bridge the gap between the high-level discrete action space learned by the VLN agent, and the robot’s low-level continuous action space, we propose a subgoal model to identify nearby waypoints, and use domain randomization to mitigate visual domain differences. For accurate sim and real comparisons in parallel environments, we annotate a 325m2 office space with 1.3km of navigation instructions, and create a digitized replica in simulation. We find that sim-to-real transfer to an environment not seen in training is successful if an occupancy map and navigation graph can be collected and annotated in advance (success rate of 46.8% vs. 55.9% in sim), but much more challenging in the hardest setting with no prior mapping at all (success rate of 22.5%).

Predictive models have been at the core of many robotic systems, from quadrotors to walking robots.

Previous approaches to learning models in the context of robotic manipulation have either learned whole image dynamics or used autoencoders to learn dynamics in a low-dimensional latent state. In this work, we introduce model-based prediction with self-supervised visual correspondence learning, and show that not only is this indeed possible, but demonstrate that these types of predictive models show compelling performance improvements over alternative methods for vision-based RL with autoencoder-type vision training.

Collaboration requires agents to align their goals on the fly. Underlying the human ability to align goals with other agents is their ability to predict the intentions of others and actively update their own plans. We propose hierarchical predictive planning (HPP), a model-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized multiagent rendezvous. Starting with pretrained, single-agent point to point navigation policies and using noisy, high-dimensional sensor inputs like lidar, we first learn via self-supervision motion predictions of all agents on the team. Next, HPP uses the prediction models to propose and evaluate navigation subgoals for completing the rendezvous task without explicit communication among agents. We evaluate HPP in a suite of unseen environments, with increasing complexity and numbers of obstacles. We show that HPP outperforms alternative reinforcement learning, path planning, and heuristic-based baselines on challenging, unseen environments. Experiments in the real world demonstrate successful transfer of the prediction models from sim to real world without any additional fine-tuning. Altogether, HPP removes the need for a centralized operator in multiagent systems by combining model-based RL and inference methods, enabling agents to dynamically align plans. Video . Reviews .

In this work, we propose the Transporter Network, a simple model architecture that rearranges deep features to infer spatial displacements from visual input - which can parameterize robot actions. It makes no assumptions of objectness (e.g. canonical poses, models, or keypoints), it exploits spatial symmetries, and is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than our benchmarked alternatives in learning vision-based manipulation tasks: from stacking a pyramid of blocks, to assembling kits with unseen objects; from manipulating deformable ropes, to pushing piles of small objects with closed-loop feedback. Our method can represent complex multi-modal policy distributions and generalizes to multi-step sequential tasks, as well as 6DoF pick-and-place. Experiments on 10 simulated tasks show that it learns faster and generalizes better than a variety of end-to-end baselines, including policies that use ground-truth object poses.

We aim to help users estimate the state of the world in tasks like robotic teleoperation and navigation with visual impairment, where user may have systematic biases that lead to suboptimal behavior: they might struggle to process observations from multiple sensors simultaneously, receive delayed observations, or underestimate distances to obstacles. While we cannot directly change the user’s internal beliefs or their internal state estimation process, our insight is that we can still assist them by modifying the user’s observations. Instead of showing the user their true observations, we synthesize new observations that lead to more accurate internal state estimates when processed by the user. We refer to this method as assistive state estimation (ASE): an automated assistant uses the true observations to infer the state of the world, then generates a modified observation for the user to consume (e.g., through an augmented reality interface), and optimizes the modification to induce the user’s new beliefs to match the assistant’s current beliefs. To predict the effect of the modified observation on the user’s beliefs, ASE learns a model of the user’s state estimation process: after each task completion, it searches for a model that would have led to beliefs that explain the user’s actions. We evaluate ASE in a user study with 12 participants who each perform four tasks: two tasks with known user biases - bandwidth-limited image classification and a driving video game with observation delay - and two with unknown biases that our method has to learn - guided 2D navigation and a lunar lander teleoperation video game. ASE’s general-purpose approach to synthesizing informative observations enables a different assistance strategy to emerge in each domain, such as quickly revealing informative pixels to speed up image classification, using a dynamics model to undo observation delay in driving, identifying nearby landmarks for navigation, and exaggerating a visual indicator of tilt in the lander game. The results show that ASE substantially improves the task performance of users with bandwidth constraints, observation delay, and other unknown biases. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

James Taylor (Lancaster University); Marc Hanheide (University of Lincoln); Gerhard Neumann (KIT) . Abstract . Estimating accurate forward and inverse dynamics models is a crucial component of model-based control for sophisticated robots such as robots driven by hydraulics, artificial muscles, or robots dealing with different contact situations. Analytic models to such processes are often unavailable or inaccurate due to complex hysteresis effects, unmodelled friction and stiction phenomena, and unknown effects during contact situations. A promising approach is to obtain spatio-temporal models in a data-driven way using recurrent neural networks, as they can overcome those issues. However, such models often do not meet accuracy demands sufficiently, degenerate in performance for the required high sampling frequencies and cannot provide uncertainty estimates. We adopt a recent probabilistic recurrent neural network architecture, called Recurrent Kalman Networks (RKNs), to model learning by conditioning its transition dynamics on the control actions. RKNs outperform standard recurrent networks such as LSTMs on many state estimation tasks.Inspired by Kalman filters, the RKN provides an elegant way to achieve action conditioning within its recurrent cell by leveraging additive interactions between the current latent state and the action variables. We present two architectures, one for forward model learning and one for inverse model learning. Both architectures significantly outperform existing model learning frameworks as well as analytical models in terms of prediction performance on a variety of real robot dynamics models. Video .

As a promising topic in cognitive robotics, neuro-symbolic modeling integrates symbolic reasoning and neural representation altogether. However, previous neuro-symbolic models usually wire their structures and the connections manually, making the underlying parameters sub-optimal. In this work, we propose the Neuro-Symbolic Program Search (NSPS) to improve the autonomous driving system design. NSPS is a novel automated search method that synthesizes the Neuro-Symbolic Programs. It can produce robust and expressive Neuro-Symbolic Programs and automatically tune the hyper-parameters. We validate NSPS in the CARLA driving simulation environment. The resulting Neuro-Symbolic Decision Programs successfully handle multiple traffic scenarios. Compared with previous neural-network-based driving and rule-based methods, our neuro-symbolic driving pipeline achieves more stable and safer behaviors in complex driving scenarios while maintaining an interpretable symbolic decision-making process.

Abstract . Untangling ropes, wires, and cables is a challenging task for robots due to the high-dimensional configuration space, visual homogeneity, self-occlusions, and complex dynamics. We consider dense (tight) knots that lack space between self-intersections and present an iterative approach that uses learned geometric structure in configurations. We instantiate this into an algorithm, HULK: Hierarchical Untangling from Learned Keypoints, which combines learning-based perception with a geometric planner into a policy that guides a bilateral robot to untangle knots. To evaluate the policy, we perform experiments both in a novel simulation environment modelling cables with varied knot types and textures and in a physical system using the da Vinci surgical robot. We find that HULK is able to untangle cables with dense figure-eight and overhand knots and generalize to varied textures and appearances. We compare two variants of HULK to three baselines and observe that HULK achieves 43.3% higher success rates on a physical system compared to the next best baseline. HULK successfully untangles a cable from a dense initial configuration containing up to two overhand and figure-eight knots in 97.9% of 378 simulation experiments with an average of 12.1 actions per trial. In physical experiments, HULK achieves 61.7% untangling success, averaging 8.48 actions per trial. Supplementary material, code, and videos can be found at https://tinyurl.com/y3a88ycu. Video .

Abstract . In this paper, we present LiRaNet, a novel end-to-end trajectory prediction method which utilizes radar sensor information along with widely used lidar and HD maps. Automotive radar provides rich, complementary information, allowing for longer range vehicle detection as well as instantaneous radial velocity measurements. However, there are factors that make the fusion of lidar and radar information challenging, such as the relatively low angular resolution of radar measurements, their sparsity and the lack of exact time synchronization with lidar. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient spatio-temporal radar feature extraction scheme which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale datasets. Further, by incorporating radar information, we show a 52% reduction in prediction error for objects with high acceleration and a 16% reduction in prediction error for objects at longer range.

Abstract . We study continuous action reinforcement learning problems in which it is crucial that the agent interacts with the environment only through near-safe policies, i.e.,~policies that keep the agent in desirable situations, both during training and at convergence. We formulate these problems as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) and present safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on a Lyapunov approach to solve them. Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient (PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while enforcing near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the policy parameter or the selected action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, in practice our action-projection algorithm often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline. We evaluate our algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art baselines on several simulated (MuJoCo) tasks, as well as a real-world robot obstacle-avoidance problem, demonstrating their effectiveness in terms of balancing performance and constraint satisfaction.

To determine if a skill can be executed in any given environment, a robot needs to learn the preconditions for the skill. As robots begin to operate in dynamic and unstructured environments, these precondition models will need to generalize to variable number of objects with different shapes and sizes. In this work, we focus on learning precondition models for manipulation skills in unconstrained environments. Our work is motivated by the intuition that many complex manipulation tasks, with multiple objects, can be simplified by focusing on less complex pairwise object relations. We propose an object-relation model that learns continuous representations for these pairwise object relations. Our object-relation model is trained completely in simulation, and once learned, is used by a separate precondition model to predict skill preconditions for real world tasks. We evaluate our precondition model on 3 different manipulation tasks: sweeping, cutting, and unstacking. We show that our approach leads to significant improvements in predicting preconditions for all 3 tasks, across objects of different shapes and sizes. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

To succeed in such behavior reasoning, we build a conditional prediction model to forecast goal-oriented trajectories with the following stages: (i) relational inference where we encode relational interactions of vehicles using the perceptual context; (ii) intention estimation to compute the probability distributions of intentional goals based on the inferred relations; and (iii) behavior reasoning where we reason about the behaviors of vehicles as trajectories conditioned on the intentions.

Dense pointcloud data require a computationally expensive feature encoding process before semantic segmentation.

Abstract . Predicting the future behavior of moving agents is essential for real world applications. It is challenging as the intent of the agent and the corresponding behavior is unknown and intrinsically multimodal. Our key insight is that for prediction within a moderate time horizon, the future modes can be effectively captured by a set of target states. This leads to our target-driven trajectory prediction (TNT) framework. TNT has three stages which are trained end-to-end. It first predicts an agent’s potential target states T steps into the future, by encoding its interactions with the environment and the other agents. TNT then generates trajectory state sequences conditioned on targets. A final stage estimates trajectory likelihoods and a final compact set of trajectory predictions is selected. This is in contrast to previous work which models agent intents as latent variables, and relies on test-time sampling to generate diverse trajectories. We benchmark TNT on trajectory prediction of vehicles and pedestrians, where we achieve better than state-of-the-art performance on Argoverse Forecasting, INTERACTION, Stanford Drone and an in-house Pedestrian-at-Intersection dataset.

Abstract . Learning dexterous manipulation in high-dimensional state-action spaces is an important open challenge with exploration presenting a major bottleneck. Although in many cases the learning process could be guided by demonstrations or other suboptimal experts, current RL algorithms for continuous action spaces often fail to effectively utilize combinations of highly off-policy expert data and on-policy exploration data. As a solution, we introduce Relative Entropy Q-Learning (REQ), a simple policy iteration algorithm that combines ideas from successful offline and conventional RL algorithms. It represents the optimal policy via importance sampling from a learned prior and is well-suited to take advantage of mixed data distributions. We demonstrate experimentally that REQ outperforms several strong baselines on robotic manipulation tasks for which suboptimal experts are available. We show how suboptimal experts can be constructed effectively by composing simple waypoint tracking controllers, and we also show how learned primitives can be combined with waypoint controllers to obtain reference behaviors to bootstrap a complex manipulation task on a simulated bimanual robot with human-like hands. Finally, we show that REQ is also effective for general off-policy RL, offline RL, and RL from demonstrations. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

A physically-motivated noise model is presented to capture stochastic behavior of the balls upon collision with the environment. A likelihood-free Bayesian inference framework is used to infer the parameters of the noise model, as well as a material property called the coefficient of restitution, from audio observations. The same inference framework and the calibrated stochastic simulator are then used to learn a probabilistic model of ball dynamics. The predictive capabilities of the dynamics model are tested in two robotic experiments. First, open-loop predictions anticipate probabilistic success of bouncing a ball into a cup. The second experiment integrates audio perception with a robotic arm to track and deflect a bouncing ball in real-time.

Next, for a new object with known geometry, we learn a tailored perception model completely in simulation. To do so, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of object poses would produce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape obtained from the sensor output, we match it against the pre-computed set using the object-specific embedding learned purely in simulation using contrastive learning. This results in a perception model that can localize objects from a single tactile observation. It also allows reasoning over pose distributions and including additional pose constraints coming from other perception systems or multiple contacts. We provide quantitative results for four objects. Our approach provides high accuracy pose estimations from distinctive tactile observations while regressing pose distributions to account for those contact shapes that could result from different object poses.

Abstract . Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated to be useful for a wide variety of robotics applications. To address sample efficiency and safety during training, it is common to train Deep RL policies in a simulator and then deploy to the real world, a process called Sim2Real transfer. For robotics applications, the deployment heterogeneities and runtime compute stochasticity results in variable timing characteristics of sensor sampling rates and end-to-end delays from sensing to actuation. Prior works have used the technique of domain randomization to enable the successful transfer of policies across domains having different state transition delays. We show that variation in sampling rates and policy execution time leads to degradation in Deep RL policy performance, and that domain randomization is insufficient to overcome this limitation. We propose the Time-in-State RL (TSRL) approach, which includes delays and sampling rate as additional agent observations at training time to improve the robustness of Deep RL policies.

Abstract . Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that can learn sophisticated locomotion behaviour for a wide spectrum of legged robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions constant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine different types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we demonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable locomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional instrumentation of the learning setup.

Meta-planning, or learning to guide planning from experience, is a promising approach to improving the computational cost of planning. A general meta-planning strategy is to learn to impose constraints on the states considered and actions taken by the agent. We observe that (1) imposing a constraint can induce context-specific independences that render some aspects of the domain irrelevant, and (2) an agent can take advantage of this fact by imposing constraints on its own behavior. These observations lead us to propose the context-specific abstract Markov decision process (CAMP), an abstraction of a factored MDP that affords efficient planning. We then describe how to learn constraints to impose so the CAMP optimizes a trade-off between rewards and computational cost. Our experiments consider five planners across four domains, including robotic navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO), robotic task and motion planning for sequential manipulation, and classical planning. We find planning with learned CAMPs to consistently outperform baselines, including Stilman’s NAMO-specific algorithm. Video: https://youtu.be/wTXt6djcAd4 Code: https://git.io/JTnf6 . Video .

    "content": "Paper PDF . Authors . Sadegh Rabiee (University of Texas at Austin)*; Joydeep Biswas (University of Texas at Austin) . Abstract . Existing solutions to visual simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM) assume that errors in feature extraction and matching are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), but this assumption is known to not be true - features extracted from low-contrast regions of images exhibit wider error distributions than features from sharp corners. Furthermore, V-SLAM algorithms are prone to catastrophic tracking failures when sensed images include challenging conditions such as specular reflections, lens flare, or shadows of dynamic objects. To address such failures, previous work has focused on building more robust visual frontends, to filter out challenging features. In this paper, we present introspective vision for SLAM (IV-SLAM), a fundamentally different approach for addressing these challenges. IV-SLAM explicitly models the noise process of reprojection errors from visual features to be context-dependent, and hence non-i.i.d. We introduce an autonomously supervised approach for IV-SLAM to collect training data to learn such a context-aware noise model. Using this learned noise model, IV-SLAM guides feature extraction to select more features from parts of the image that are likely to result in lower noise, and further incorporate the learned noise model into the joint maximum likelihood estimation, thus making it robust to the aforementioned types of errors. We present empirical results to demonstrate that IV-SLAM 1) is able to accurately predict sources of error in input images, 2) reduces tracking error compared to V-SLAM, and 3) increases the mean distance between tracking failures by more than 70% on challenging real robot data compared to V-SLAM.

This paper presents FeatureGan, a methodology to train image translators (generators) using an unpaired image training set. FeatureGan is based on the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and has three main novel components: (i) the use of a feature loss to ensure alignment between the input and the generated image, (ii) the use of a feature pyramid discriminator, which uses a tensor composed of features at different levels of abstraction generated by a pre-trained network, and (iii) the introduction of a per class loss to improve the results in the simulation-to-reality task. The main advantage of the proposed methodology when compared to classical approaches is a more stable training process, which includes a higher resilience to common GAN problems such as mode collapse, as well as better and more consistent results. FeatureGan is also fast to train, easy to replicate, and especially suited to be used in simulation-to-reality applications where the generated realistic images allow to close the visual simulation-to-reality gap. As a proof of concept, we show the application of the proposed methodology in soccer robotics, where realistic images are generated in a soccer robotics simulator, and robot and ball detectors are trained using these images and then tested in reality. The same methodology is used to generate realistic images from images rendered in a video game. The realistic images are then used to train a semantic segmentation network. Video . Reviews .

Felix Schiel (DLR German Aerospace Center); Annette Hagengruber (DLR German Aerospace Center)*; Jörn Vogel (DLR German Aerospace Center); Rudolph Triebel (German Aerospace Center (DLR)) . Abstract . Myoelectric control is the process of controlling a prosthesis or an assistive robot by using electrical signals of the muscles. Pattern recognition in myoelectric control is a challenging field, since the underlying distribution of the signal is likely to change during the application. Covariate shifts, including changes of the arm position or different levels of muscular activation, often lead to significant instability of the control signal. This work tries to overcome these challenges by enhancing a myoelectric human machine interface through the use of the sparse Gaussian Process (sGP) approximation Variational Free Energy and by the introduction of a novel adaptive model based on an unsupervised incremental learning approach. The novel adaptive model integrates an interclass and intraclass distance to improve prediction stability under challenging conditions. Furthermore, it demonstrates the successful incorporation of incremental updates which is shown to lead to a significantly increased performance and higher stability of the predictions in an online user study.

Imitation learning is the problem of recovering an expert policy without access to a reward signal. Behavior cloning and GAIL are two widely used methods for performing imitation learning. Behavior cloning converges in a few iterations, but doesn’t achieve peak performance due to its inherent iid assumption about the state-action distribution. GAIL addresses the issue by accounting for the temporal dependencies when performing a state distribution matching between the agent and the expert. Although GAIL is sample efficient in the number of expert trajectories required, it is still not very sample efficient in terms of the environment interactions needed for convergence of the policy. Given the complementary benefits of both methods, we present a simple and elegant method to combine both methods to enable stable and sample efficient learning. Our algorithm is very simple to implement and integrates with different policy gradient algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in low dimensional control tasks, gridworlds and in high dimensional image-based tasks. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . State-of-the-art quadrotor simulators have a rigid and highly-specialized structure: either are they really fast, physically accurate, or photo-realistic. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift in the development of simulators: moving the trade-off between accuracy and speed from the developers to the end-users. We use this idea to develop a flexible quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.

Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown great success in learning complex control policies for a variety of applications in robotics.

In this study, we explore the problem of learning hardware and control parameters together in a unified RL framework. To achieve this, we propose to model the robot body as a “hardware policy”, analogous to and optimized jointly with its computational counterpart. We show that, by modeling such hardware policies as auto-differentiable computational graphs, the ensuing optimization problem can be solved efficiently by gradient-based algorithms from the Policy Optimization family. We present two such design examples: a toy mass-spring problem, and a real-world problem of designing an underactuated hand. We compare our method against traditional co-optimization approaches, and also demonstrate its effectiveness by building a physical prototype based on the learned hardware parameters.

Davi Frossard (Uber Advanced Technologies Group / University of Toronto)*; Shun Da Suo (Uber ATG, University of Toronto); Sergio Casas (University of Toronto); James Tu (Uber ATG); Raquel Urtasun (Uber ATG) . Abstract . Many modern robotics systems employ LiDAR as their main sensing modality due to its geometrical richness. Rolling shutter LIDARs are particularly common, in which a sweep is built through the accumulation of points over an entire revolution of the sensor, thus producing a 360 point cloud of the scene. Modern perception algorithms wait for the full sweep to be built before processing the data, which introduces an additional latency of up to 100ms. As a consequence, by the time an output is produced, it no longer accurately reflects the state of the world. This poses a big challenge, as robotics applications require minimal reaction times, such that maneuvers can be quickly planned in the event of a safety-critical situation. In this paper we propose StrObe, a novel approach that minimizes latency by ingesting packets of LiDAR and emitting a stream of detections without waiting for the full sweep to be built. StrObe reuses computations from previous points and iteratively updates the spatial memory of the scene as new evidence comes in, resulting in latency reduced accurate perception. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large scale dataset, showing that our approach far outperforms the state-of-the-art when latency is taken into account while still matching the performance in the traditional setting.

Robust task-oriented grasp planning is vital for autonomous robotic precision assembly tasks. Knowledge of the objects’ geometry and preconditions of the target task should be incorporated when determining the proper grasp to execute. However, several factors contribute to the challenges of realizing these grasps such as noise when controlling the robot, unknown object properties, and difficulties modeling complex object-object interactions. We propose a method that decomposes this problem and optimizes for grasp robustness, precision, and task performance by learning three cascaded networks. We evaluate our method in simulation on three common assembly tasks: inserting gears onto pegs, aligning brackets into corners, and inserting shapes into slots. Our policies are trained using a curriculum based on large-scale self-supervised grasp simulations with procedurally generated objects. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the first two tasks with a real robot where our method achieves 4.28mm error for bracket insertion and 1.44mm error for gear insertion. Video . Reviews .

Abstract . Visual localization is a crucial requirement in mobile robotics, field and service robotics, and self-driving cars. Recently, unsupervised learning with Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) has shown to produce spatial representations that enable localization from holistic images. The approach is faster and much less complex than state-of-the-art monocular visual SLAM methods while achieving similar localization performance in small-scale environments. However, the holistic approach’s performance drops significantly for highly complex, large-scale environments due to scene variations occurring during a training phase. Instead of using holistic images, an alternative is to perform localization relative to unique regions present in a scene. Therefore, in this paper, we add a new component to the SFA localization pipeline that leverages state-of-the-art CNN to identify unique image regions. Hence we propose a hybrid approach that first learns such regions with a pre-trained CNN and then uses SFA for unsupervised pose estimation relative to each region. We present the experimental results from an autonomous robot in two different outdoor environments of varying complexity and size. The experiments show the proposed hybrid approach outperforms holistic SFA w.r.t localization accuracy in both environments, but benefits are more pronounced in the large-scale environment. Video .

Accurate object segmentation is a crucial task in the context of robotic manipulation. However, creating sufficient annotated training data for neural networks is particularly time consuming and often requires manual labeling. To this end, we propose a simple, yet robust solution for learning to segment unknown objects grasped by a robot. Specifically, we exploit motion and temporal cues in RGB video sequences. Using optical flow estimation we first learn to predict segmentation masks of our given manipulator. Then, these annotations are used in combination with motion cues to automatically distinguish between background, manipulator and unknown, grasped object. In contrast to existing systems our approach is fully self-supervised and independent of precise camera calibration, 3D models or potentially imperfect depth data. We perform a thorough comparison with alternative baselines and approaches from literature. The object masks and views are shown to be suitable training data for segmentation networks that generalize to novel environments and also allow for watertight 3D reconstruction. Video . Reviews .

Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable autonomous agents, such as robots, to quickly acquire new behaviors by leveraging prior experience in a set of related training tasks. However, the onerous data requirements of meta-training compounded with the challenge of learning from sensory inputs such as images have made meta-RL challenging to apply to real robotic systems. Latent state models, which learn compact state representations from a sequence of observations, can accelerate representation learning from visual inputs. In this paper, we leverage the perspective of meta-learning as task inference to show that latent state models can also perform meta-learning given an appropriately defined observation space. Building on this insight, we develop meta-RL with latent dynamics (MELD), an algorithm for meta-RL from images that performs inference in a latent state model to quickly acquire new skills given observations and rewards. MELD outperforms prior meta-RL methods on several simulated image-based robotic control problems, and enables a real WidowX robotic arm to insert an Ethernet cable into new locations given a sparse task completion signal after only 8 hours of real world meta-training. To our knowledge, MELD is the first meta-RL algorithm trained in a real-world robotic control setting from images. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

These two levels are connected by a low dimensional hidden layer, which we call latent command. HL receives a first-person camera view, whereas LL receives the latent command from HL and the robot’s on-board sensors to control its actuators. We train policies to walk in two different environments: a curved cliff and a maze. We show that hierarchical policies can concurrently learn to locomote and navigate in these environments, and show they are more efficient than non-hierarchical neural network policies. This architecture also allows for knowledge reuse across tasks. LL networks trained on one task can be transferred to a new task in a new environment. Finally HL, which processes camera images, can be evaluated at much lower and varying frequencies compared to LL, thus reducing computation times and bandwidth requirements. Video . Reviews .

Learning from Demonstration (LfD) seeks to democratize robotics by enabling non-roboticist end-users to teach robots to perform a task by providing a human demonstration.

We overcome these limitations in developing a novel approach that bootstraps off suboptimal demonstrations to synthesize optimality-parameterized data to train an idealized reward function. We empirically validate we learn an idealized reward function with ~0.95 correlation with ground-truth reward versus ~0.75 for prior work. We can then train policies achieving ~200% improvement over the suboptimal demonstration and ~90% improvement over prior work.

Simulators are a critical component of modern robotics research. Strategies for both perception and decision making can be studied in simulation first, before deployed to real world systems, saving on time and costs. Despite significant progress on the development of sim-to-real algorithms, the analysis of different methods is still conducted in an ad-hoc manner without a consistent set of tests and metrics for comparison. This paper intends to fill this gap and proposes a set of benchmarks and a framework for the study of various algorithms aimed to transfer models and policies learnt in simulation to the real world. We conduct experiments on a wide range of well known simulated environments to characterise and offer insights into the performance of different algorithms. Our analysis can be useful for practitioners working in this area and can help make informed choices about the behaviour and main properties of sim-to-real algorithms. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . Many existing tools in nonlinear control theory for establishing stability or safety of a dynamical system can be distilled to the construction of a certificate function which guarantees a desired property. However, algorithms for synthesizing certificate functions typically require a closed-form analytical expression of the underlying dynamics, which rules out their use on many modern robotic platforms. To circumvent this issue, we develop algorithms for learning certificate functions only from trajectory data. We establish bounds on the generalization error - the probability that a certificate will not certify a new, unseen trajectory - when learning from trajectories, and we convert such generalization error bounds into global stability guarantees. We demonstrate empirically that certificates for complex dynamics can be efficiently learned, and that the learned certificates can be used for downstream tasks such as adaptive control. Video .

Abstract . Motivated by the lack of systematic tools to obtain safe control laws for hybrid systems, we propose an optimization-based framework for learning certifiably safe control laws from data. In particular, we assume a setting in which the system dynamics are known and in which data exhibiting safe system behavior is available. We propose hybrid control barrier functions for hybrid systems as a means to synthesize safe control inputs. Based on this notion, we present an optimization-based framework to learn such hybrid control barrier functions from data. Importantly, we identify sufficient conditions on the data such that feasibility of the optimization problem ensures correctness of the learned hybrid control barrier functions, and hence the safety of the system. We illustrate our findings in two simulations studies, including a compass gait walker. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

We present a new method for multi-modal, long-term vehicle trajectory prediction. Our approach relies on using lane centerlines captured in rich maps of the environment to generate a set of proposed goal paths for each vehicle. Using these paths - which are generated at run time and therefore dynamically adapt to the scene - as spatial anchors, we predict a set of goal-based trajectories along with a categorical distribution over the goals. This approach allows us to directly model the goal-directed behavior of traffic actors, which unlocks the potential for more accurate long-term prediction. Our experimental results on both a large-scale internal driving dataset and on the public nuScenes dataset show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for vehicle trajectory prediction over a 6-second horizon. We also empirically demonstrate that our model is better able to generalize to road scenes from a completely new city than existing methods. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Autonomous robot systems for applications from search and rescue to assistive guidance should be able to engage in natural language dialog with people. To study such cooperative communication, we introduce Robot Simultaneous Localization and Mapping with Natural Language (RobotSlang), a benchmark of 169 natural language dialogs between a human Driver controlling a robot and a human Commander providing guidance towards navigation goals. In each trial, the pair first cooperates to localize the robot on a global map visible to the Commander, then the Driver follows Commander instructions to move the robot to a sequence of target objects. We introduce a Localization from Dialog History (LDH) and a Navigation from Dialog History (NDH) task where a learned agent is given dialog and visual observations from the robot platform as input and must localize in the global map or navigate towards the next target object, respectively. RobotSlang is comprised of nearly 5k utterances and over 1k minutes of robot camera and control streams.

We present a closed-loop multi-arm motion planner that is scalable and flexible with team size. Traditional multi-arm robotic systems have relied on centralized motion planners, whose run times often scale exponentially with team size, and thus, fail to handle dynamic environments with open-loop control. In this paper, we tackle this problem with multi-agent reinforcement learning, where a shared policy network is trained to control each individual robot arm to reach its target end-effector pose given observations of its workspace state and target end-effector pose. The policy is trained using Soft Actor-Critic with expert demonstrations from a sampling-based motion planning algorithm (i.e., BiRRT). By leveraging classical planning algorithms, we can improve the learning efficiency of the reinforcement learning algorithm while retaining the fast inference time of neural networks. The resulting policy scales sub-linearly and can be deployed on multi-arm systems with variable team sizes. Thanks to the closed-loop and decentralized formulation, our approach generalizes to 5-10 multiarm systems and dynamic moving targets (&gt;90% success rate for a 10-arm system), despite being trained on only 1-4 arm planning tasks with static targets.

Many real-world problems require the coordination of multiple autonomous agents. Recent work has shown the promise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn explicit communication strategies that enable complex multi-agent coordination. These works use models of cooperative multi-agent systems whereby agents strive to achieve a shared global goal. When considering agents with self-interested local objectives, the standard design choice is to model these as separate learning systems (albeit sharing the same environment). Such a design choice, however, precludes the existence of a single, differentiable communication channel, and consequently prohibits the learning of inter-agent communication strategies. In this work, we address this gap by presenting a learning model that accommodates individual non-shared rewards and a differentiable communication channel that is common among all agents. We focus on the case where agents have self-interested objectives, and develop a learning algorithm that elicits the emergence of adversarial communications. We perform experiments on multi-agent coverage and path planning problems, and employ a post-hoc interpretability technique to visualize the messages that agents communicate to each other. We show how a single self-interested agent is capable of learning highly manipulative communication strategies that allows it to significantly outperform a cooperative team of agents. Video .

In learning from demonstrations, many generative models of trajectories make simplifying assumptions of independence. Correctness is sacrificed in the name of tractability and speed of the learning phase. The ignored dependencies, which are often the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the system, are then only restored when synthesizing the motion, which introduces possibly heavy distortions. In this work, we propose to use those approximate trajectory distributions as close-to-optimal discriminators in the popular generative adversarial framework to stabilize and accelerate the learning procedure. The two problems of adaptability and robustness are addressed with our method. In order to adapt the motions to varying contexts, we propose to use a product of Gaussian policies defined in several parametrized task spaces. Robustness to perturbations and varying dynamics is ensured with the use of stochastic gradient descent and ensemble methods to learn the stochastic dynamics.

Abstract . Recent learning-based LiDAR odometry methods have demonstrated their competitiveness. However, most methods still face two substantial challenges: 1) the 2D projection representation of LiDAR data cannot effectively encode 3D structures from the point clouds; 2) the needs for a large amount of labeled data for training limit the application scope of these methods. In this paper, we propose an self-supervised LiDAR odometry method, dubbed SelfVoxeLO, to tackle these two difficulties. Specifically, we propose a 3D convolution network to process the raw LiDAR data directly, which extracts features that better encode the 3D geometric patterns. To suit our network to self-supervised learning, we design several novel loss functions that utilize the inherent properties of LiDAR point clouds. Moreover, an uncertainty-aware mechanism is incorporated in the loss functions to alleviate the interference of moving objects/noises. We evaluate our method’s performances on two large-scale datasets, i.e., KITTI and Apollo-SouthBay.Our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 27%/32% in terms of translational/rotational errors on the KITTI dataset and also performs well on the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. By including more unlabelled training data, our method can further improve performance comparable to the supervised methods. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Action selection policies (ASPs), used to compose low-level robot skills into complex high-level tasks are commonly represented as neural networks (NNs) in the state of the art. Such a paradigm, while very effective, suffers from a few key problems: 1) NNs are opaque to the user and hence not amenable to verification, 2) they require significant amounts of training data, and 3) they are hard to repair when the domain changes. We present two key insights about ASPs for robotics. First, ASPs need to reason about physically meaningful quantities derived from the state of the world, and second, there exists a layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we introduce layered dimension-informed program synthesis (LDIPS) – by reasoning about the physical dimensions of state variables, and dimensional constraints on operators, LDIPS directly synthesizes ASPs in a human-interpretable domain-specific language that is amenable to program repair. We present empirical results to demonstrate that LDIPS 1) can synthesize effective ASPs for robot soccer and autonomous driving domains, 2) requires two orders of magnitude fewer training examples than a comparable NN representation, and 3) can repair the synthesized ASPs with only a small number of corrections when transferring from simulation to real robots.

Abstract . Learning-based 3D object reconstruction enables single- or few-shot estimation of 3D object models. For robotics, this holds the potential to allow model-based methods to rapidly adapt to novel objects and scenes. Existing 3D reconstruction techniques optimize for visual reconstruction fidelity, typically measured by chamfer distance or voxel IOU. We find that when applied to realistic, cluttered robotics environments, these systems produce reconstructions with low physical realism, resulting in poor task performance when used for model-based control. We propose ARM, an amodal 3D reconstruction system that introduces (1) a stability prior over object shapes, (2) a connectivity prior, and (3) a multi-channel input representation that allows for reasoning over relationships between groups of objects. By using these priors over the physical properties of objects, our system improves reconstruction quality not just by standard visual metrics, but also performance of model-based control on a variety of robotics manipulation tasks in challenging, cluttered environments.

David Surovik (University of Oxford)*; Oliwier Melon (University of Oxford); Mathieu Geisert (University of Oxford); Maurice Fallon (University of Oxford); Ioannis Havoutis (“Oxford Robotics Institute, Universtity of Oxford”) . Abstract . Function approximators are increasingly being considered as a tool for generating robot motions that are temporally extended and express foresight about the scenario at hand. While these longer behaviors are often necessary or beneficial, they also induce multimodality in the decision space, which complicates the training of a regression model on expert data. Motivated by the problem of quadrupedal locomotion over obstacles, we apply an approach that disentangles modal variation from task-to-solution regression by using a conditional variational autoencoder. The resulting decoder is a regression model that outputs trajectories based on the task and a real-valued latent mode vector representing a style of behavior. With the task consisting of robot-relative descriptions of the state, the goal, and nearby obstacles, this model is suitable for receding-horizon generation of structured dynamic motion. We test this approach, along with a trajectory library baseline method, for producing sustained locomotion plans that use a generalized gait. Both options strongly bias planned footholds away from obstacle regions, while the multimodal regressor is far less susceptible to violating kinematic constraints. We conclude by identifying further prospective benefits of the continuous latent mode representation, along with targets for future integration into a hardware-deployable pipeline including perception and control.

Our framework shows a significant improvement of around 12% on held-out settings compared to baseline methods which do not use semantics.

Our method plans in the space of object subgoals and frees the planner from reasoning about robot-object interaction dynamics. We show that for rigid-bodies, this abstraction can be realized using low-level manipulation skills that maintain sticking-contact with the object and represent subgoals as 3D transformations. To enable generalization to unseen objects and improve planning performance, we propose a novel way of representing subgoals for rigid-body manipulation and a graph-attention based neural network architecture for processing point-cloud inputs. We experimentally validate these choices using simulated and real-world experiments on the YuMi robot. Results demonstrate that our method can successfully manipulate new objects into target configurations requiring long-term planning.

Michel Breyer (ETH)*; Jen Jen Chung (ETH Zurich); Lionel Ott (The University of Sydney); Roland Siegwart (ETH Zürich, Autonomous Systems Lab); Juan Nieto (ETH Zürich Autonomous Systems Lab) . Abstract . General robot grasping in clutter requires the ability to synthesize grasps that work for previously unseen objects and that are also robust to physical interactions, such as collisions with other objects in the scene. In this work, we design and train a network that predicts 6 DOF grasps from 3D scene information gathered from an on-board sensor such as a wrist-mounted depth camera. Our proposed Volumetric Grasping Network (VGN) accepts a Truncated Signed Distance Function (TSDF) representation of the scene and directly outputs the predicted grasp quality and the associated gripper orientation and opening width for each voxel in the queried 3D volume. We show that our approach can plan grasps in only 10 ms and is able to clear 92% of the objects in real-world clutter removal experiments without the need for explicit collision checking. The real-time capability opens up the possibility for closed-loop grasp planning, allowing robots to handle disturbances, recover from errors and provide increased robustness. Video . Reviews .

    "content": "Paper PDF Code . Authors . Hengli Wang (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology)*; Rui Fan (UC San Diego); Ming Liu (HKUST) . Abstract . The interpretation of ego motion and scene change is a fundamental task for mobile robots. Optical flow information can be employed to estimate motion in the surroundings. Recently, unsupervised optical flow estimation has become a research hotspot. However, unsupervised approaches are often easy to be unreliable on partially occluded or texture-less regions. To deal with this problem, we propose CoT-AMFlow in this paper, an unsupervised optical flow estimation approach. In terms of the network architecture, we develop an adaptive modulation network that employs two novel module types, flow modulation modules (FMMs) and cost volume modulation modules (CMMs), to remove outliers in challenging regions. As for the training paradigm, we adopt a co-teaching strategy, where two networks simultaneously teach each other about challenging regions to further improve accuracy. Experimental results on the MPI Sintel, KITTI Flow and Middlebury Flow benchmarks demonstrate that our CoT-AMFlow outperforms all other state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, while still running in real time.

Hai Nguyen (Northeastern University)*; Brett Daley (Northeastern University); Xinchao Song (Northeastern University); Christopher Amato (Northeastern University); Robert Platt (Northeastern University) . Abstract . Many important robotics problems are partially observable where a single visual or force-feedback measurement is insufficient to reconstruct the state. Standard approaches involve learning a policy over beliefs or observation-action histories. However, both of these have drawbacks; it is expensive to track the belief online, and it is hard to learn policies directly over histories. We propose a method for policy learning under partial observability called the Belief-Grounded Network (BGN) in which an auxiliary belief-reconstruction loss incentivizes a neural network to concisely summarize its input history. Since the resulting policy is a function of the history rather than the belief, it can be executed easily at runtime. We compare BGN against several baselines on classic benchmark tasks as well as three novel robotic force-feedback tasks. BGN outperforms all other tested methods and its learned policies work well when transferred onto a physical robot. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . We propose an action-conditioned dynamics model that predicts scene changes caused by object and agent interactions in a viewpoint-invariant 3D neural scene representation space, inferred from RGB-D videos. In this 3D feature space, objects do not interfere with one another and their appearance persists over time and across viewpoints. This permits our model to predict future scenes long in the future by simply “moving” 3D object features based on cumulative object motion predictions. Object motion predictions are computed by a graph neural network that operates over the object features extracted from the 3D neural scene representation. Our model’s simulations can be decoded by a neural renderer into 2D image views from any desired viewpoint, which aids the interpretability of our latent 3D simulation space. We show our model generalizes well its predictions across varying number and appearances of interacting objects as well as across camera viewpoints, outperforming existing 2D and 3D dynamics models. We further demonstrate sim-to-real transfer of the learnt dynamics by applying our model trained solely in simulation to model-based control for pushing objects to desired locations under clutter on a real robotic setup.

    "content": "Paper PDF Code . Authors . Christopher Wang (MIT)*; Candace Ross (Massachusetts Institute of Technology); Yen-Ling Kuo (MIT); Boris Katz (MIT); Andrei Barbu (MIT) . Abstract . Children acquire their native language with apparent ease by observing how language is used in context and attempting to use it themselves. They do so without laborious annotations, negative examples, or even direct corrections. We take a step toward robots that can do the same by training a grounded semantic parser, which discovers latent linguistic representations that can be used for the execution of natural-language commands. In particular, we focus on the difficult domain of commands with a temporal aspect, whose semantics we capture with Linear Temporal Logic, LTL. Our parser is trained with pairs of sentences and executions as well as an executor. At training time, the parser hypothesizes a meaning representation for the input as a formula in LTL. Three competing pressures allow the parser to discover meaning from language. First, any hypothesized meaning for a sentence must be permissive enough to reflect all the annotated execution trajectories. Second, the executor - a pretrained end-to-end LTL planner - must find that the observed trajectories are likely executions of the meaning. Finally, a generator, which reconstructs the original input, encourages the model to find representations that conserve knowledge about the command. Together these ensure that the meaning is neither too general nor too specific. Our model generalizes well, being able to parse and execute both machine-generated and human-generated commands, with near-equal accuracy, despite the fact that the human-generated sentences are much more varied and complex with an open lexicon. The approach presented here is not specific to LTL: it can be applied to any domain where sentence meanings can be hypothesized and an executor can verify these meanings, thus opening the door to many applications for robotic agents.

The goal of offline reinforcement learning is to learn a policy from a fixed dataset, without further interactions with the environment.

Existing off-policy algorithms have limited performance on static datasets due to extrapolation errors from out-of-distribution actions. This leads to the challenge of constraining the policy to select actions within the support of the dataset during training. We propose to simply learn the Policy in the Latent Action Space (PLAS) such that this requirement is naturally satisfied.

Florian Achermann (ETH Zurich)*; Andrey Kolobov (Microsoft); Debadeepta Dey (Microsoft); Timo Hinzmann (ETH Zürich); Jen Jen Chung (ETH Zurich); Roland Siegwart (ETH Zürich, Autonomous Systems Lab); Nicholas Lawrance (ETH Zürich) . Abstract . While optical cameras are ubiquitous in robotics, some robots can sense the world in several sections of the electromagnetic spectrum simultaneously, which can extend their capabilities in fundamental ways. For instance, many fixed-wing UAVs carry both optical and thermal imaging cameras, potentially allowing them to detect temperature difference-induced atmospheric updrafts, map their locations, and adjust their flight path accordingly to increase their time aloft. A key step for unlocking the potential offered by multi-spectral data is generating consistent, multi-spectral maps of the environment. In this work, we introduce MultiPoint, a novel data-driven method for generating interest points and associated descriptors for registering optical and thermal image pairs without knowledge of the relative camera viewpoints. Existing pixel-based alignment methods are accurate but too slow to work in near-real time, while feature-based methods such as SuperPoint are fast but produce poor-quality cross-spectral matches due to interest point instability in thermal images. MultiPoint capitalizes on the strengths of both approaches. An offline mutual information-based procedure is used to align cross-spectral image pairs from a training set, which are then processed by our generalized multi-spectral homographic adaptation stage to generate highly repeatable interest points that are invariant across viewpoint changes in both spectra. These are used to train a MultiPoint deep neural network by exposing this model to both same-spectrum and cross-spectral image pairs. This model is then deployed for fast and accurate online interest point detection. We show that MultiPoint outperforms existing techniques for feature-based image alignment using a dataset of real-world thermal-optical imagery captured by a UAV during flights in different conditions and release this dataset, the first of its kind.

Abstract . Autonomous driving systems have a pipeline of perception, decision, planning, and control. The decision module processes information from the perception module and directs the execution of downstream planning and control modules. On the other hand, the recent success of deep learning suggests that this pipeline could be replaced by end-to-end neural control policies, however, safety cannot be well guaranteed for the data-driven neural networks. In this work, we propose a hybrid framework to learn neural decisions in the classical modular pipeline through end-to-end imitation learning. This hybrid framework can preserve the merits of the classical pipeline such as the strict enforcement of physical and logical constraints while learning complex driving decisions from data. To circumvent the ambiguous annotation of human driving decisions, our method learns high-level driving decisions by imitating low-level control behaviors. We show in the simulation experiments that our modular driving agent can generalize its driving decision and control to various complex scenarios where the rule-based programs fail. It can also generate smoother and safer driving trajectories than end-to-end neural policies. Demo and code are available at https://decisionforce.github.io/modulardecision/. Video . Reviews .

The 3D shape of a robot’s end-effector plays a critical role in determining it’s functionality and overall performance. Many of today’s industrial applications rely on highly customized gripper design for a given task to ensure the system’s robustness and accuracy. However, the process of manual hardware design is both costly and time-consuming, and the quality of the design is also dependent on the engineer’s experience and domain expertise, which can easily be out-dated or inaccurate. The goal of this paper is to use machine learning algorithms to automate this design process and generate task-specific gripper designs that satisfy a set of pre-defined design objectives. We model the design objectives by training a Fitness network to predict their values for a pair of gripper fingers and a grasp object.

Abstract . In this paper we consider infinite horizon discounted dynamic programming problems with finite state and control spaces, partial state observations, and a multiagent structure. We discuss and compare algorithms that simultaneously or sequentially optimize the agents’ controls by using multistep lookahead, truncated rollout with a known base policy, and a terminal cost function approximation. Our methods specifically address the computational challenges of partially observable multiagent problems. In particular: 1) We consider rollout algorithms that dramatically reduce required computation while preserving the key cost improvement property of the standard rollout method. The per-step computational requirements for our methods are on the order of O(Cm) as compared with O(C^m) for standard rollout, where C is the maximum cardinality of the constraint set for the control component of each agent, and m is the number of agents. 2) We show that our methods can be applied to challenging problems with a graph structure, including a class of robot repair problems whereby multiple robots collaboratively inspect and repair a system under partial information. 3) We provide a simulation study that compares our methods with existing methods, and demonstrate that our methods can handle larger and more complex partially observable multiagent problems (state space size 1E37 and control space size 1E7, respectively). In particular, we verify experimentally that our multiagent rollout methods perform nearly as well as standard rollout for problems with few agents, and produce satisfactory policies for problems with a larger number of agents that are intractable by standard rollout and other state of the art methods. Finally, we incorporate our multiagent rollout algorithms as building blocks in an approximate policy iteration scheme, where successive rollout policies are approximated by using neural network classifiers. While this scheme requires a strictly off-line implementation, it works well in our computational experiments and produces additional significant performance improvement over the single online rollout iteration method.

This paper presents Deep Latent Competition (DLC), a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that learns competitive visual control policies through self-play in imagination. The DLC agent imagines multi-agent interaction sequences in the compact latent space of a learned world model that combines a joint transition function with opponent viewpoint prediction. Imagined self-play reduces costly sample generation in the real world, while the latent representation enables planning to scale gracefully with observation dimensionality. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in learning competitive behaviors on a novel multi-agent racing benchmark that requires planning from image observations.

Abstract . Dexterous object manipulation is still an open problem in robotics, despite the rapid progress in machine learning during the past decade. We argue that a key issue which has hindered progress is the high cost of experimentation on real systems, in terms of both time and money. We address this problem by proposing a novel open-source robotic platform, consisting of hardware and software, to drastically reduce the cost of experimentation. The hardware is inexpensive yet highly dynamic, robust, and capable of complex contact interaction with external objects. The software allows for 1-kilohertz real-time control and performs safety checks to prevent the hardware from breaking. These properties enable the platform to run without human supervision. In addition, we provide easy-to-use C++ and Python interfaces. We illustrate the potential of the proposed platform by performing an object-manipulation task using an optimal-control algorithm and training a learning-based method directly on the real system.

Abstract . As multi-robot applications become more prevalent, it becomes necessary to develop navigation systems which allow autonomous mobile robots to efficiently and safely pass each other in confined spaces. Existing navigation systems, such as the widely used ROS Navigation Stack, usually produce safe, collision free paths in static environments. However, these systems are not perfect, and when multiple mobile robots simultaneously navigate in narrow spaces, collisions and turnarounds are not uncommon. Fine-tuning and enhancing such navigation stacks is not as simple as it looks since they are made up of multiple layers of code, and there exists a tradeoff between optimizing for efficiency, i.e. minimizing time to destination (TTD) vs. optimizing for safety, i.e. minimizing collisions, with each objective leading to a different combination of parameter values. In this paper we develop a methodology to improve existing navigation stacks with regards to both objectives, without tuning their parameters, while preserving their inherent safety control properties. Our proposed approach is a decentralized learning-based approach that is geared toward real world robotic deployment, by requiring little computing resources. It is agnostic of the underlying navigation stack and can adapt to different types of environmental layouts (i.e., hallway structures). Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . To equip robots with dexterous skills, an effective approach is to first transfer the desired skill via Learning from Demonstration (LfD), then let the robot improve it by self-exploration via Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we propose a novel LfD+RL framework, namely Adaptive Conditional Neural Movement Primitives (ACNMP), that allows efficient policy improvement in novel environments and effective skill transfer between different agents. This is achieved through exploiting the latent representation learned by the underlying Conditional Neural Process (CNP) model, and simultaneous training of the model with supervised learning (SL) for acquiring the demonstrated trajectories and via RL for new trajectory discovery. Through simulation experiments, we show that (i) ACNMP enables the system to extrapolate to situations where pure LfD fails; (ii) Simultaneous training of the system through SL and RL preserves the shape of demonstrations while adapting to novel situations due to the shared representations used by both learners; (iii) ACNMP enables order-of-magnitude sample-efficient RL in extrapolation of reaching tasks compared to the existing approaches; (iv) ACNMPs can be used to implement skill transfer between robots having different morphology, with competitive learning speeds and importantly with less number of assumptions compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we show the real-world suitability of ACNMPs through real robot experiments that involve obstacle avoidance, pick and place and pouring actions. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Autonomous race cars require perception, estimation, planning, and control modules which work together asynchronously while driving at the limit of a vehicle’s handling capability.

The root cause is the difficulty in identifying vehicle model parameters that capture the effects of lateral tire slip.

Abstract . The main novelty of the proposed approach is that it allows a robot to learn an end-to-end policy which can adapt to changes in the environment during execution. While goal conditioning of policies has been studied in the RL literature, such approaches are not easily extended to settings where the robot’s goal can change during execution. This is something that humans are naturally able to do. However, it is difficult for robots to learn such reflexes (i.e., to naturally respond to dynamic environments), especially when the goal location is not explicitly provided to the robot, and instead needs to be perceived through a vision sensor. In the current work, we present a method that can achieve such behavior by combining traditional kinematic planning, deep learning, and deep reinforcement learning in a synergistic fashion to generalize to arbitrary environments. We demonstrate the proposed approach for several reaching and pick-and-place tasks in simulation, as well as on a real system of a 6-DoF industrial manipulator. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Intelligent agents rely heavily on prior experience when learning a new task, yet most modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn every task from scratch. One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills learned on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior experience increases, the number of transferable skills grows too, making it challenging to explore the full set of available skills during downstream learning. Yet, intuitively, not all skills should be explored with equal probability; for example information about the current state can hint which skills are promising to explore. In this work, we propose to implement this intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose a deep latent variable model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and the skill prior from offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy RL approaches to use skill priors to guide downstream learning. We validate our approach, SPiRL (Skill-Prior RL), on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks and show that learned skill priors are essential for effective skill transfer from rich datasets.

In robot navigation, generalizing quickly to unseen environments is essential. Hierarchical methods inspired by human navigation have been proposed, typically consisting of a high-level landmark proposer and a low-level controller. However, these methods either require precise high-level information to be given in advance, or need to construct such guidance from extensive interaction with the environment. In this work, we propose an approach that leverages a rough 2-D map of the environment to navigate in novel environments without requiring further learning. In particular, we introduce a dynamic topological map that can be initialized from the rough 2-D map along with a high-level planning approach for proposing reachable 2-D map patches of the intermediate landmarks between the start and goal locations. To use proposed 2-D patches, we train a deep generative model to generate intermediate landmarks in observation space which are used as subgoals by low-level goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Importantly, because the low-level controller is only trained with local behaviors (e.g. go across the intersection, turn left at a corner) on existing environments, this framework allows us to generalize to novel environments given only a rough 2-D map, without requiring further learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both seen and novel environments. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Abstract . Visual imitation learning provides a framework for learning complex manipulation behaviors by leveraging human demonstrations. However, current interfaces for imitation such as kinesthetic teaching or teleoperation prohibitively restrict our ability to efficiently collect large-scale data in the wild. Obtaining such diverse demonstration data is paramount for the generalization of learned skills to novel scenarios. In this work, we present an alternate interface for imitation that simplifies the data collection process while allowing for easy transfer to robots. We use commercially available reacher-grabber assistive tools both as a data collection device and as the robot’s end-effector. To extract action information from these visual demonstrations, we use off-the-shelf Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques in addition to training a finger detection network. We experimentally evaluate on two challenging tasks: non-prehensile pushing and prehensile stacking, with 1000 diverse demonstrations for each task. For both tasks, we use standard behavior cloning to learn executable policies from the previously collected offline demonstrations. To improve learning performance, we employ a variety of data augmentations and provide an extensive analysis of its effects. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our interface by evaluating on real robotic scenarios with previously unseen objects and achieve a 87% success rate on pushing and a 62% success rate on stacking.

Learning reward functions from data is a promising path towards achieving scalable Reinforcement Learning (RL) for robotics. However, a major challenge in training agents from learned reward models is that the agent can learn to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high reward behaviors that do not correspond to the intended task. These reward delusions can lead to unintended and even dangerous behaviors. On the other hand, adversarial imitation learning frameworks (Ho et al., 2016) tend to suffer the opposite problem, where the discriminator learns to trivially distinguish agent and expert behavior, resulting in reward models that produce low reward signal regardless of the input state. In this paper, we connect these two classes of reward learning methods to positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, and show that by applying a large-scale PU learning algorithm to the reward learning problem, we can address both the reward under- and over-estimation problems simultaneously.

Guangzhi Tang (Rutgers University); Neelesh Kumar (Rutgers University); Raymond Yoo (Rutgers University); Konstantinos Michmizos (Rutgers University)* . Abstract . The energy-efficient control of mobile robots has become crucial as the complexity of their real-world applications increasingly involves high-dimensional observation and action spaces, which cannot be offset by their limited on-board resources. An emerging non-Von Neumann model of intelligence, where spiking neural networks (SNNs) are executed on neuromorphic processors, is now considered as an energy-efficient and robust alternative to the state-of-the-art real-time robotic controllers for low dimensional control tasks. The challenge now for this new computing paradigm is to scale so that it can keep up with real-world applications. To do so, SNNs need to overcome the inherent limitations of their training, namely the limited ability of their spiking neurons to represent information and the lack of effective learning algorithms. Here, we propose a population-coded spiking actor network (PopSAN) that was trained in conjunction with a deep critic network using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The population coding scheme, which is prevalent across brain networks, dramatically increased the representation capacity of the network and the hybrid learning combined the training advantages of deep networks with the energy-efficient inference of spiking networks. To show that our approach can be used for general-purpose spike-based reinforcement learning, we demonstrated its integration with a wide spectrum of policy-gradient based DRL methods covering both on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. We deployed the trained PopSAN on Intel’s Loihi neuromorphic chip and benchmarked our method against the mainstream DRL algorithms for continuous control. To allow for a fair comparison among all methods, we validated them on OpenAI gym tasks. Our Loihi-run PopSAN consumed 140 times less energy per inference when compared against the deep actor network on Jetson TX2, and achieved the same level of performance. Our results demonstrate the overall efficiency of neuromorphic controllers and suggest the hybrid reinforcement learning approach as an alternative to deep learning, when both energy-efficiency and robustness are important.

Policy learning for delicate industrial insertion tasks (e.g., PC board assembly) is challenging. This paper considers two major problems: how to learn a diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently handle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to handle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we propose tolerance-guided policy learning. To encourage transferability of the learned policy to different workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policy’s input space using the insertion tolerance. Then we train the policy using generative adversarial imitation learning with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a variety of representative situations. To encourage adaptability of the learned policy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference model that can output the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the tolerance model. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned policy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion tasks in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn optimal policies under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance the transferability of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes the policy robust to defects on the workpieces.

Additionally, we leverage recent work on robust deep learning and propose a new adversarial sampling approach to robustify our algorithm and accelerate its convergence. We demonstrate that our method is faster and less conservative than prior work, present results for approximate reachability analysis of neural networks and robust trajectory optimization of high-dimensional uncertain nonlinear systems, and discuss future applications.

Humans are able to seamlessly visually imitate others, by inferring their intentions and using past experience to achieve the same end goal. In other words, we can parse complex semantic knowledge from raw video and efficiently translate that into concrete motor control. Is it possible to give a robot this same capability? Prior research in robot imitation learning has created agents which can acquire diverse skills from expert human operators. However, expanding these techniques to work with a single positive example during test time is still an open challenge. Apart from control, the difficulty stems from mismatches between the demonstrator and robot domains. For example, objects may be placed in different locations (e.g. kitchen layouts are different in every house). Additionally, the demonstration may come from an agent with different morphology and physical appearance (e.g. human), so one-to-one action correspondences are not available. This paper investigates techniques which allow robots to partially bridge these domain gaps, using their past experience. A neural network is trained to mimic ground truth robot actions given context video from another agent, and must generalize to unseen task instances when prompted with new videos during test time. We hypothesize that our policy representations must be both context driven and dynamics aware in order to perform these tasks. These assumptions are baked into the neural network using the Transformers attention mechanism and a self-supervised inverse dynamics loss. Finally, we experimentally determine that our method accomplishes a 2x improvement in terms of task success rate over prior baselines in a suite of one-shot manipulation tasks. Video . Reviews .

We present a self-supervised representation learning approach for visual reasoning and integrate it into a nonlinear program formulation for motion optimization to tackle sequential manipulation tasks. Such problems have usually been addressed by combined task and motion planning approaches, for which spatial relations and logical rules that rely on symbolic representations have to be predefined by the user. We propose to learn relational structures by leveraging visual perception to alleviate the resulting knowledge acquisition bottleneck.

This representation allows us to plan high-level discrete decisions effectively using graph search algorithms. We integrate the visual reasoning module with a nonlinear optimization method for robot motion planning and verify its feasibility on the classic blocks-world domain. Our proposed framework successfully finds the sequence of actions and enables the robot to execute feasible motion plans to realize the given tasks. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

Ryan Julian (University of Southern California)*; Benjamin Swanson (Google); Gaurav Sukhatme (University of Southern California); Sergey Levine (Google); Chelsea Finn (Google Brain); Karol Hausman (Google Brain) . Abstract . One of the great promises of robot learning systems is that they will be able to learn from their mistakes and continuously adapt to ever-changing environments. Despite this potential, most of the robot learning systems today produce static policies that are not further adapted during deployment, because the algorithms which produce those policies are not designed for continual adaptation. We present an adaptation method, and empirical evidence that it supports a robot learning framework for continual adaption. We show that this very simple method–fine-tuning off-policy reinforcement learning using offline datasets–is robust to changes in background, object shape and appearance, lighting conditions, and robot morphology. We demonstrate how to adapt vision-based robotic manipulation policies to new variations using less than 0.2% of the data necessary to learn the task from scratch. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this robustness holds in an episodic continual learning setting. We also show that pre-training via RL is essential: training from scratch or adapting from super vised ImageNet features are both unsuccessful with such small amounts of data. Our empirical conclusions are consistently supported by experiments on simulated manipulation tasks, and by 60 unique fine-tuning experiments on a real robotic grasping system pre-trained on 580,000 grasps.

    "content": "Paper PDF Code . Authors . Sean Gillen (UCSB)*; Katie Byl (UCSB) . Abstract . A key limitation in using various modern methods of machine learning in developing feedback control policies is the lack of appropriate methodologies to analyze their long-term dynamics, in terms of making any sort of guarantees (even statistically) about robustness. The central reasons for this are largely due to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box nature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the first of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite large in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control methods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics that are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this work we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools from fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension. We then show that the dimensionality of trajectories induced by model free reinforcement learning agents can be influenced adding a post processing function to the agents reward signal. We verify that the dimensionality reduction is robust to noise being added to the system and show that that the modified agents are more actually more robust to noise and push disturbances in general for the systems we examined.

With the increasing reliance of self-driving and similar robotic systems on robust 3D vision, the processing of LiDAR scans with deep convolutional neural networks has become a trend in academia and industry alike. Prior attempts on the challenging Semantic Scene Completion task - which entails the inference of dense 3D structure and associated semantic labels from “sparse” representations - have been, to a degree, successful in small indoor scenes when provided with dense point clouds or dense depth maps often fused with semantic segmentation maps from RGB images. However, the performance of these systems drop drastically when applied to large outdoor scenes characterized by dynamic and exponentially sparser conditions. Likewise, processing of the entire sparse volume becomes infeasible due to memory limitations and workarounds introduce computational inefficiency as practitioners are forced to divide the overall volume into multiple equal segments and infer on each individually, rendering real-time performance impossible. In this work, we formulate a method that subsumes the sparsity of large-scale environments and present S3CNet, a sparse convolution based neural network that predicts the semantically completed scene from a single, unified LiDAR point cloud. We show that our proposed method outperforms all counterparts on the 3D task, achieving state-of-the art results on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. Furthermore, we propose a 2D variant of S3CNet with a multi-view fusion strategy to complement our 3D network, providing robustness to occlusions and extreme sparsity in distant regions. We conduct experiments for the 2D semantic scene completion task and compare the results of our sparse 2D network against several leading LiDAR segmentation models adapted for bird’s eye view segmentation on two open-source datasets.

Avi Singh (UC Berkeley)*; Albert Yu (UC Berkeley); Jonathan Yang (UC Berkeley); Jesse Zhang (UC Berkeley); Aviral Kumar (UC Berkeley); Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley) . Abstract . Reinforcement learning has been applied to a wide variety of robotics problems, but most of such applications involve collecting data from scratch for each new task. Since the amount of robot data we can collect for any single task is limited by time and cost considerations, the learned behavior is typically narrow: the policy can only execute the task in a handful of scenarios that it was trained on. What if there was a way to incorporate a large amount of prior data, either from previously solved tasks or from unsupervised or undirected environment interaction, to extend and generalize learned behaviors? While most prior work on extending robotic skills using pre-collected data focuses on building explicit hierarchies or skill decompositions, we show in this paper that we can reuse prior data to extend new skills simply through model-free reinforcement learning via dynamic programming. We show that even when the prior data does not actually succeed at solving the new task, it can still be utilized for learning a better policy, by providing the agent with a broader understanding of the mechanics of its environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an approach by chaining together several behaviors seen in prior datasets for solving a new task, with our hardest experimental setting involving composing four robotic skills in a row: picking, placing, drawer opening, and grasping, where a +1/0 sparse reward is provided only on task completion. We train our policies in an end-to-end fashion, mapping high-dimensional image observations to low-level robot control commands, and present results in both simulated and real world domains. Video .

Learning depth and ego-motion from unlabeled videos via self-supervision from epipolar projection can improve the robustness and accuracy of the 3D perception and localization of vision-based robots. However, the rigid projection computed by ego-motion cannot represent all scene points, such as points on moving objects, leading to false guidance in these regions.

We further propose a novel MotionNet with an ASANet as the encoder, followed by two separate decoders, to estimate the camera’s ego-motion and the scene’s dynamic motion field. Then, we introduce an auto-selecting approach to detect the moving objects for dynamic-aware learning automatically.

Our experiments show that an affordance-based driving model pre-trained with this approach can leverage a relatively small amount of weakly annotated imagery and outperform pure end-to-end driving models, while being more interpretable.

Junha Roh (University of Washington); Christoforos Mavrogiannis (University of Washington)*; Rishabh Madan (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur); Dieter Fox (NVIDIA Research / University of Washington); Siddhartha Srinivasa (University of Washington) . Abstract . We focus on decentralized navigation among multiple non-communicating rational agents at uncontrolled intersections, i.e., street intersections without traffic signs or signals. Avoiding collisions in such domains relies on the ability of agents to predict each others’ intentions reliably, and react quickly. Multiagent trajectory prediction is NP-hard whereas the sample complexity of existing data-driven approaches limits their applicability. Our key insight is that the geometric structure of the intersection and the incentive of agents to move efficiently and avoid collisions (rationality) reduces the space of likely behaviors, effectively relaxing the problem of trajectory prediction. In this paper, we collapse the space of multiagent trajectories at an intersection into a set of modes representing different classes of multiagent behavior, formalized using a notion of topological invariance. Based on this formalism, we design Multiple Topologies Prediction (MTP), a data-driven trajectory-prediction mechanism that reconstructs trajectory representations of high-likelihood modes in multiagent intersection scenes. We show that MTP outperforms a state-of-the-art multimodal trajectory prediction baseline (MFP) in terms of prediction accuracy by 78.24% on a challenging simulated dataset. Finally, we show that MTP enables our optimization-based planner, MTPnav, to achieve collision-free and time-efficient navigation across a variety of challenging intersection scenarios on the CARLA simulator.

Abstract . Reasoning about human motion is a core component of modern human-robot interactive systems. In particular, one of the main uses of behavior prediction in autonomous systems is to inform robot motion planning and control. However, a majority of planning and control algorithms reason about system dynamics rather than the predicted agent tracklets (i.e., ordered sets of waypoints) that are commonly output by trajectory forecasting methods, which can hinder their integration. Towards this end, we propose Mixtures of Affine Time-varying Systems (MATS) as an output representation for trajectory forecasting that is more amenable to downstream planning and control use. Our approach leverages successful ideas from probabilistic trajectory forecasting works to learn dynamical system representations that are well-studied in the planning and control literature.

Abstract . Vision-based robotics often factors the control loop into separate components for perception and control. Conventional perception components usually extract hand-engineered features from the visual input that are then used by the control component in an explicit manner. In contrast, recent advances in deep RL make it possible to learn these features end-to-end during training, but the final result is often brittle, fails unexpectedly under minuscule visual shifts, and comes with a high sample complexity cost. In this work, we study the effects of using mid-level visual representations asynchronously trained for traditional computer vision objectives as a generic and easy-to-decode perceptual state in an end-to-end RL framework. We show that the invariances provided by the mid-level representations aid generalization, improve sample complexity, and lead to a higher final performance. Compared to the alternative approaches for incorporating invariances, such as domain randomization, using asynchronously trained mid-level representations scale better to harder problems and larger domain shifts, and consequently, successfully trains policies for tasks where domain randomization or learning-from-scratch failed.

Abstract . During retinal microsurgery, precise manipulation of the delicate retinal tissue is required for positive surgical outcome. However, accurate manipulation and navigation of surgical tools remain difficult due to a constrained workspace and the top-down view during the surgery, which limits the surgeon’s ability to estimate depth. To alleviate such difficulty, we propose to automate the tool-navigation task by learning to predict relative goal position on the retinal surface from the current tool-tip position. Given an estimated target on the retina, we generate an optimal trajectory leading to the predicted goal while imposing safety-related physical constraints aimed to minimize tissue damage. As an extended task, we generate goal predictions to various points across the retina to localize eye geometry and further generate safe trajectories within the estimated confines. Through experiments in both simulation and with several eye phantoms, we demonstrate that our framework can permit navigation to various points on the retina within 0.089mm and 0.118mm in xy error which is less than the human’s surgeon mean tremor at the tool-tip of 0.180mm.

Abstract . Interaction is fundamental in autonomous driving (AD). Despite more than a decade of intensive R&amp;D in AD, how to dynamically interact with diverse road users in various contexts still remains unsolved. Multi-agent learning has recently seen big breakthroughs and has much to offer towards solving realistic interaction in AD. However, to realize this potential we need multi-agent AD simulation of realistic interaction. To break this apparent chicken-and-egg circularity, we built an AD simulation platform called SMARTS (Scalable Multi-Agent Rl Training School), which is designed to accumulate behavior models of road users towards increasingly realistic and diverse interaction that in turn enables deeper and broader multi-agent research on interaction. In this paper, we describe the design goals of SMARTS, explain its key architectural ideas, illustrate its use for multi-agent research through experiments on concrete interaction scenarios, and introduce a set of benchmarks and metrics. As an open-source, industrial-strength platform, the future of SMARTS lies in its growth along with the multi-agent research it enables in the years to come. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

The crucial step for localization is to match the current observation to the map. When the two sensor modalities are significantly different, matching becomes challenging. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep phase correlation network (DPCN) to match heterogeneous sensor measurements. In DPCN, the primary component is a differentiable correlation-based estimator that back-propagates the pose error to learnable feature extractors, which addresses the problem that there are no direct common features for supervision. In addition, it eliminates the exhaustive evaluation in some previous methods, improving efficiency. With the interpretable modeling, the network is light-weighted and promising for better generalization. We evaluate the system on both the simulation data and Aero-Ground Dataset which consists of heterogeneous sensor images and aerial images acquired by satellites or aerial robots. The results show that our method is able to match the heterogeneous sensor measurements, outperforming the comparative traditional phase correlation and other learning-based methods.

Abstract . LiDAR is an important method for autonomous driving systems to sense the environment. The point clouds obtained by LiDAR typically exhibit sparse and irregular distribution, thus posing great challenges to the detection of 3D objects, especially those that are small and distant. To tackle this difficulty, we propose Reconfigurable Voxels, a new approach to constructing representations from 3D point clouds. Specifically, we devise a biased random walk scheme, which adaptively covers each neighborhood with a fixed number of voxels based on the local spatial distribution and produces a representation by integrating the points in the chosen neighbors. We found empirically that this approach effectively improves the stability of voxel features, especially for sparse regions. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Lyft, and KITTI, show that this new representation can remarkably improve the detection performance for small and distant objects, without incurring noticeable overhead cost .

Humans are adept at learning new tasks by watching a few instructional videos.

In this paper, we explore a method that facilitates learning object manipulation skills directly from videos. Leveraging recent advances in 2D visual recognition and differentiable rendering, we develop an optimization based method to estimate a coarse 3D state representation for the hand and the manipulated object(s) without requiring any supervision. We use these trajectories as dense rewards for an agent that learns to mimic them through reinforcement learning. We evaluate our method on simple single- and two-object actions from the Something-Something dataset. Our approach allows an agent to learn actions from single videos, while watching multiple demonstrations makes the policy more robust.

Xinshuo Weng (Carnegie Mellon University)*; Jianren Wang (Carnegie Mellon University); Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley); Kris Kitani (Carnegie Mellon University); Nicholas Rhinehart (UC Berkeley) . Abstract . Many autonomous systems forecast aspects of the future in order to aid decision-making. For example, self-driving vehicles and robotic manipulation systems often forecast future object poses by first detecting and tracking objects. However, this detect-then-forecast pipeline is expensive to scale, as pose forecasting algorithms typically require labeled sequences of object poses, which are costly to obtain in 3D space. Can we scale performance without requiring additional labels? We hypothesize yes, and propose inverting the detect-then-forecast pipeline. Instead of detecting, tracking and then forecasting the objects, we propose to first forecast 3D sensor data (e.g., point clouds with 100k points) and then detect/track objects on the predicted point cloud sequences to obtain future poses, i.e., a forecast-then-detect pipeline. This inversion makes it less expensive to scale pose forecasting, as the sensor data forecasting task requires no labels. Part of this work’s focus is on the challenging first step - Sequential Pointcloud Forecasting (SPF), for which we also propose an effective approach, SPFNet. To compare our forecast-then-detect pipeline relative to the detect-then-forecast pipeline, we propose an evaluation procedure and two metrics. Through experiments on a robotic manipulation dataset and two driving datasets, we show that SPFNet is effective for the SPF task, our forecast-then-detect pipeline outperforms the detect-then-forecast approaches to which we compared, and that pose forecasting performance improves with the addition of unlabeled data.

Abstract . Recent work has presented embodied agents that can navigate to point-goal targets in novel indoor environments with near-perfect accuracy. However, these agents are equipped with idealized sensors for localization and take deterministic actions. This setting is practically sterile by comparison to the dirty reality of noisy sensors and actuations in the real world - wheels can slip, motion sensors have error, actuations can rebound. In this work, we take a step towards this noisy reality, developing point-goal navigation agents that rely on visual estimates of egomotion under noisy action dynamics. We find these agents outperform naive adaptions of current point-goal agents to this setting as well as those incorporating classic localization baselines. Further, our model conceptually divides learning agent dynamics or odometry (where am I?) from task-specific navigation policy (where do I want to go?). This enables a seamless adaption to changing dynamics (a different robot or floor type) by simply re-calibrating the visual odometry model - circumventing the expense of re-training of the navigation policy. Our agent was the runner-up in the PointNav track of CVPR 2020 Habitat Challenge. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",

To navigate safely in urban environments, an autonomous vehicle (ego vehicle) must understand and anticipate its surroundings, in particular the behavior and intents of other road users (neighbors). Most of the times, multiple decision choices are acceptable for all road users (e.g., turn right or left, or different ways of avoiding an obstacle), leading to a highly uncertain and multi-modal decision space. We focus here on predicting multiple feasible future trajectories for both ego vehicle and neighbors through a probabilistic framework. We rely on a conditional imitation learning algorithm, conditioned by a navigation command for the ego vehicle (e.g., “turn right”). Our model processes ego vehicle front-facing camera images and bird-eye view grid, computed from Lidar point clouds, with detections of past and present objects, in order to generate multiple trajectories for both ego vehicle and its neighbors. Our approach is computationally efficient and relies only on on-board sensors. We evaluate our method offline on the publicly available dataset nuScenes, achieving state-of-the-art performance, investigate the impact of our architecture choices on online simulated experiments and show preliminary insights for real vehicle control.

Karl Schmeckpeper (University of Pennsylvania)*; Oleh Rybkin (University of Pennsylvania); Kostas Daniilidis (University of Pennsylvania); Sergey Levine (UC Berkeley); Chelsea Finn (Stanford) . Abstract . Reinforcement learning is a powerful framework for robots to acquire skills from experience, but often requires a substantial amount of online data collection. As a result, it is difficult to collect sufficiently diverse experiences that are needed for robots to generalize broadly. Videos of humans, on the other hand, are a readily available source of broad and interesting experiences. In this paper, we consider the question: can we perform reinforcement learning directly on experience collected by humans? This problem is particularly difficult, as such videos are not annotated with actions and exhibit substantial visual domain shift relative to the robot’s embodiment. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for reinforcement learning with videos (RLV). RLV learns a policy and value function using experience collected by humans in combination with data collected by robots. In our experiments, we find that RLV is able to leverage such videos to learn challenging vision-based skills with less than half as many samples as RL methods that learn from scratch. Video .

    "content": "Paper PDF . Authors . Michael Danielczuk (UC Berkeley); Ashwin Balakrishna (UC Berkeley)*; Daniel Brown (University of Texas at Austin); Ken Goldberg (UC Berkeley) . Abstract . There has been significant recent work on data-driven algorithms for learning general-purpose grasping policies. However, these policies can consistently fail to grasp challenging objects which are significantly out of the distribution of objects in the training data or which have very few high quality grasps. Motivated by such objects, we propose a novel problem setting, Exploratory Grasping, for efficiently discovering reliable grasps on an unknown polyhedral object via sequential grasping, releasing, and toppling. We formalize Exploratory Grasping as a Markov Decision Process where we assume that the robot can (1) distinguish stable poses of a polyhedral object of unknown geometry, (2) generate grasp candidates on these poses and execute them, (3) determine whether each grasp is successful, and (4) release the object into a random new pose after a grasp successor topple the object after a grasp failure. We study the theoretical complexity of Exploratory Grasping in the context of reinforcement learning and present an efficient bandit-style algorithm, Bandits for Online Rapid Grasp ExplorationStrategy (BORGES), which leverages the structure of the problem to efficiently discover high performing grasps for each object stable pose. BORGES can be used to complement any general-purpose grasping algorithm with any grasp modality (parallel-jaw, suction, multi-fingered, etc) to learn policies for objects in which they exhibit persistent failures. Simulation experiments suggest that BORGES can significantly outperform both general-purpose grasping pipelines and two other online learning algorithms and achieves performance within 5% of the optimal policy within 1000 and 8000 timesteps on average across 46 challenging objects from the Dex-Net adversarial and EGAD! object datasets, respectively.

Abstract . Image-based Reinforcement Learning is known to suffer from poor sample efficiency and generalisation to unseen visuals such as distractors (task-independent aspects of the observation space). Visual domain randomisation encourages transfer by training over visual factors of variation that may be encountered in the target domain. This increases learning complexity, can negatively impact learning rate and performance, and requires knowledge of potential variations during deployment. In this paper, we introduce Attention-Privileged Reinforcement Learning (APRiL) which uses a self-supervised attention mechanism to significantly alleviate these drawbacks: by focusing on task-relevant aspects of the observations, attention provides robustness to distractors as well as significantly increased learning efficiency. APRiL trains two attention-augmented actor-critic agents: one purely based on image observations, available across training and transfer domains; and one with access to privileged information (such as environment states) available only during training. Experience is shared between both agents and their attention mechanisms are aligned. The image-based policy can then be deployed without access to privileged information. We experimentally demonstrate accelerated and more robust learning on a diverse set of domains, leading to improved final performance for environments both within and outside the training distribution.

Abstract . Motivated by the impact of large-scale datasets on ML systems we present the largest self-driving dataset for motion prediction to date, containing over 1,000 hours of data.

On top of this, the dataset contains a high-definition semantic map with 15,242 labelled elements and a high-definition aerial view over the area. We show that using a dataset of this size dramatically improves performance for key self-driving problems.

Abstract . Sensor simulation is a key component for testing the performance of self-driving vehicles and for data augmentation to better train perception systems. Typical approaches rely on artists to create both 3D assets and their animations to generate a new scenario. This, however, does not scale. In contrast, we propose to recover the shape and motion of pedestrians from sensor readings captured in the wild by a self-driving car driving around. Towards this goal, we formulate the problem as energy minimization in a deep structured model that exploits human shape priors, reprojection consistency with 2D poses extracted from images, and a ray-caster that encourages the reconstructed mesh to agree with the LiDAR readings. Importantly, we do not require any ground-truth 3D scans or 3D pose annotations. We then incorporate the reconstructed pedestrian assets bank in a realistic LiDAR simulation system by performing motion retargeting, and show that the simulated LiDAR data can be used to significantly reduce the amount of annotated real-world data required for visual perception tasks.

Manipulating deformable objects has long been a challenge in robotics due to its high dimensional state representation and complex dynamics. Recent success in deep reinforcement learning provides a promising direction for learning to manipulate deformable objects with data driven methods. However, existing reinforcement learning benchmarks only cover tasks with direct state observability and simple low-dimensional dynamics or with relatively simple image-based environments, such as those with rigid objects.

Our benchmark will enable reproducible research in this important area. Further, we evaluate a variety of algorithms on these tasks and highlight challenges for reinforcement learning algorithms, including dealing with a state representation that has a high intrinsic dimensionality and is partially observable.

Abstract . A robot’s ability to act is fundamentally constrained by what it can perceive. Many existing approaches to visual representation learning utilize general-purpose training criteria, e.g. image reconstruction, smoothness in latent space, or usefulness for control, or else make use of large datasets annotated with specific features (bounding boxes, segmentations, etc.). However, both approaches often struggle to capture the fine-detail required for precision tasks on specific objects, e.g. grasping and mating a plug and socket. We argue that these difficulties arise from a lack of geometric structure in these models. In this work we advocate semantic 3D keypoints as a visual representation, and present a semi-supervised training objective that can allow instance or category-level keypoints to be trained to 1-5 millimeter-accuracy with minimal supervision. Furthermore, unlike local texture-based approaches, our model integrates contextual information from a large area and is therefore robust to occlusion, noise, and lack of discernible texture. We demonstrate that this ability to locate semantic keypoints enables high level scripting of human understandable behaviours. Finally we show that these keypoints provide a good way to define reward functions for reinforcement learning and area good representation for training agents. Video . Reviews . Rebuttal . ",
