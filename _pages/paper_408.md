#### Abstract
This paper introduces a new formulation for stochastic optimal control and stochastic  dynamic  optimization that ensures safety with respect to state and control constraints.  The proposed  methodology brings together concepts such as  Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations,  Stochastic  Barrier Functions, Differentiable Convex Optimization and Deep Learning.  Using the aforementioned concepts, a Neural Network architecture is designed for safe trajectory optimization in which learning can be performed in  an end-to-end fashion. Simulations are performed on three systems to show the efficacy of the proposed methodology.
