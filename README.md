# STARS Lab Paper Web Repository

A place to create web pages for papers published by the STARS lab.

## Instructions for authors

1. Clone this repo.

2. Create a markdown file in the `_pages` directory (see `bingham-rotation-learning.md` for an example).

3. [Optional] If you need to host images, add them to a custom folder in the `assets` directory and link to them in your markdown.

4. [Optional] Use the lovely [UI components](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/ui-components) provided by our theme [Just the Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs).

5. Preview your changes locally by setting up `jekyll` and `github-pages` and then running `bundle exec jekyll serve` (see [here](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll#step-2-install-jekyll-using-bundler) for more info).

6. When happy with your page, push back to this repo (everything should be compiled automagically).
